Project Name: Time-series Analysis - Crude Oil Price Prediction

## Overview

This project is open to anyone who is interested in predicting the future from history! We will look into the stock price of Brent Crude Oil from 2000 to 2024, a time-series data in the global arena, and manage to forecast the future price based on historical performance.
 
Unlike traditional statistical modeling or machine learning, time-series analysis has very limited data: one at a given time. This project aims to examine some classical approaches to deal with time-series data, covering ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average), a statistical method popular for time-series in econometrics, as well as LSTM, the deep learning branch well-known for sequence tasks. Besides, we could do more EDAs to try to find relationships among oil price, gold price and the value of USD, gaining a better understanding of oil price as a real-world indicator.

## Goals
Walk through an entire ARIMA procedure for a solid understanding in time-series analysis
Build an LSTM model to forecast the oil price
Gain insights in real-world economics through EDAs among prices of natural resources, gold price and USD value
(Optimistically) end up with a Medium article for demonstration

## Week-by-Week Timeline
-    Week 2: Project Planning & Data Visualization
-    Week 3: Stationary Test & White Noise Test 
-    Week 4-5: ARIMA Modeling (determine model parameters using ACF/PACF, or AIC/BIC), and model evaluation/visualization
-    Weeks 6-7: LSTM modeling, model evaluation, comparison of the two methods 
-    Week 8: EDAs surrounding oil price (how it is influenced, influencing, and what it tells)
-    Week 9: Finalize Presentation
